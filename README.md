# LLM Data Analysis with Context Injection
This repository contains an IPython notebook (data_analysis.ipynb) that demonstrates using Context Injection with a Language Model (LLM) for data analysis. The approach enables an LLM, specifically the text-davinci-003 model, to analyze and answer questions about a specific dataset without extensive fine-tuning.

## Background
Traditionally, fine-tuning focuses on improving a model's task-specific responses. For data analysis, the goal is to refine the model's responses rather than teach it new information. Context Injection allows the LLM to answer dataset-related queries effectively.

## Fine-tuning for Chatbot Interaction
The text-davinci-003 was fine-tuned to interact like a chatbot, enhancing its response capabilities.

## Context Injection Approach
Context Injection integrates the dataset into the LLM's knowledge base. Organizing and formatting the data in a vector database ensures efficient retrieval of contextually similar information.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (Python, Jupyter Notebook).
2. Obtain a valid OpenAI API key.
3. Download or clone the repository.
4. Open data_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted.
6. Set your OpenAI API key in the notebook's configuration.
7. Execute the notebook cells to load the text-davinci-003 LLM, inject the dataset, and perform data analysis tasks.

## Example Use Case
The notebook demonstrates a minimalist approach using Davinci LLMs, embedding models, and vector stores to process user queries. The technologies synergize to provide relevant and accurate answers, even with changing facts.
